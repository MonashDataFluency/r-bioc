## Bioconductor

Bioconductor is repository for R packages relating to high-throughput biology (shotgun sequencing, microarrays, etc).

* Started in 2001, has developed alongside technology and growth of data

* Core set of types promotes interoperation<br>(Not just tidy data frames! Types have evolved over time to meet new needs.)

* Twice yearly release schedule

* Many contributors, but fairly good coding and documentation standards

## Flavours of R

### Base R

Functions and types that are always available in R.

### CRAN (17,264 packages as at March 2021)

"Comprehensive R Archive Network" - main source of R packages

```{r eval=F}
install.packages("glmnet")
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

### Bioconductor (1,974 packages as at March 2021)

```{r eval=F}
# Setup
install.packages("BiocManager")

# Install a Bioconductor package
BiocManager::install("limma")

# Check for out-of-date packages
BiocManager::install()
```


## What Bioconductor is for

**Genome and genome features: genes, regions, motifs, peaks, primers, SNPs** <span style="color: #00aaaa">&larr; focus for today</span>

eg for ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, variant calling

* `Biostrings`, `GenomicRanges`, `GenomicFeatures`, ...
<br>

**Differential gene expression from microarray or RNA-seq**

* `SummarizedExperiment`, `limma`, `edgeR`, `DESeq2`, ...
* Further packages to normalize, impute, batch correct, check quality, ...
<br>

**Single-cell gene expression, etc**

* `SingleCellExperiment`, `scater`, `scran`, ...
* ["Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor" book](http://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/)
<br>

**Visualization**

* `ComplexHeatmap`, `Gviz`, `ggbio`, ...
<br>

**Statistical methods for $p \gg n$ data**

...


## More types

Can do a lot in R with vectors and data frames.

Using Bioconductor will mean building familiarity with further types:
<br>
<br>

* `matrix`, `list`
<br>
<br>

* `DNAString`, `DNAStringSet`, `GRanges` <span style="color: #00aaaa">&larr; focus for today</span>
<br>
<br>

... `Seqinfo`, `TxDb`, `EnsDb`, `OrgDb`, `VCF`, `SummarizedExperiment`, `DelayedArray`, ...

## 

### üëÄ ‚úã&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S3 types

Most base R packages use "S3" types. Data frames, tibbles, and linear model fits are examples of these.

* essentially lists
* if necessary, peek inside with `$`

<br>

### üï∂Ô∏è üëâüëâ&nbsp;&nbsp;S4 types

Bioconductor uses "S4" types, including it's own data frame (`DataFrame`) and list types (`SimpleList`, `GRangesList`, etc etc). If stuck, can almost always convert to base R types with `as.data.frame`, `as.list`, `as.character`, `as.numeric`.

* use accessor functions such as `seqnames`, `start`, `end`, `width`, `nchars`
* if absolutely necessary, peek inside with `@`

## Reference genomes and annotations

Data analysis usually occurs in the context of:

* a genome assembly
* gene and transcript annotations

For model organisms such as human and mouse, there is usually a genome assembly that is updated infrequently, and then several sets of gene annotations (Ensembl, RefSeq, UCSC) which are updated much more frequently.


## Genome browsers

On the web:

* [UCSC](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg19&lastVirtModeType=default&lastVirtModeExtraState=&virtModeType=default&virtMode=0&nonVirtPosition=&position=chr13%3A32868568%2D32994857&hgsid=1052205095_AaqJoeemFT7StcNxT3Cxn3TgBT0N)
* [Ensembl](https://asia.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Location/View?db=core;g=ENSG00000139618;r=13:32313383-32401971)

On your desktop:

* [Integrative Genomics Viewer](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/)
    * Can view many file types. 
    * View very large files such as [BAM](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/) or [bigWig](https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bigWig.html).

## Files in bioinformatics

| What|File types|R types|
| --- | --- | --- |
| DNA sequence | FASTA(I), FASTQ, 2bit(R) | Biostrings::DNAStringSet, BSgenome(R), rtracklayer::TwoBitFile(R) |
| Amino acid sequence | FASTA | Biostrings::AAStringSet |
| Genomic features | GTF(I), GFF(I), BED(I) | GenomicRanges::GRanges, GenomicFeatures::TxDb(R), ensembldb::EnsDb(R) |
| Read alignments | SAM, BAM(I) | GenomicAlignments::GAlignments, Rsamtools::BamFile(I) |
| Numeric data along a genome | wiggle, bigWig(R) | list of numeric vectors, IRanges::RleList, rtracklayer::BigWigFile(R) |
| Variant calls | VCF(I) | VariantAnnotation::VCF |
| Numeric matrix (gene expression, etc) | CSV, TSV, HDF5(R) | matrix, HDF5Array(R), DelayedArray(R), SummarizedExperiment(R), SingleCellExperiment(R), ... |

(plus many more)

` `(R) random access to large files \
` `(I) random access with an accompanying index file \
` `Prefer these file types!

`rtracklayer::import()` can read many file types.

## Command-line bioinformatics software

Not all bioinformatics software is an R package!

R's role will often be to massage your data into the form needed for command line tools, or to examine a tool's output.

<br>

One way to install command-line software is using the Conda package manager:

* [Install miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/)
* Use the [bioconda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda) channel

```
# Example
conda install -c bioconda meme
```

* Can be used on your own computer, or on a server or cluster.
* Doesn't need admin rights.

## Using Bioconductor

1. Find some useful packages
1. Read the vignettes
1. Read the reference documentation for specific functions you need
1. If you run into a funny class, check its documentation, work out the accessor functions, and in a pinch poke around its internals with `@` or try `as.data.frame`.

```{r eval=F}
?"GRanges-class"

methods(class="GRanges")
```
