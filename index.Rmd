## Workshop notes

* [Workshop](topics/sequences_and_features.html)

## Setup

This workshop is designed to work with [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/). Go to https://rstudio.cloud/ (Monash users can log in with their Monash google account) and create a new project. The workshop can also be done using R locally on your laptop (if doing this, we also recommend you create a new project to contain the files).

Running the R code below will download files and install packages used in this workshop.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Download data
download.file(
  "https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-bioc/r-bioc-files.zip",
  destfile="r-bioc-files.zip")
unzip("r-bioc-files.zip")

# Install BiocManager package from CRAN:
install.packages("BiocManager")

# Install some Bioconductor packages:
BiocManager::install(c(
    "Biostrings", 
    "BSgenome", 
    "GenomicRanges", 
    "GenomicFeatures", 
    "ensembldb", 
    "rtracklayer", 
    "seqLogo", 
    "motifRG", 
    "AnnotationHub"
), INSTALL_opts="--no-byte-compile")



# (I had problems installing packages in RStudio Cloud,
#  due to running out of memory while compiling a package.
#  Failure seemed to occur at the optional "byte compilation"
#  step, and seems to be mitigated by 
#  INSTALL_opts="--no-byte-compile".)
```
