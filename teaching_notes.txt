This should be a 3 hour workshop.

Setup: I had problems installing packages in RStudio Cloud, due to running out of memory while compiling a package. Failure seemed to occur at the optional "byte compilation" step, and seems to be mitigated by INSTALL_opts="--no-byte-compile".

Mention relevant events such as BioInfoSummer, COMBINE events.



# Things to mention during the slideshow:

R has 4 decades of history.

Tidyverse is a set of modern packages.

Tidyverse is easy to pick up, has made R much more widely accessible. Key concepts are tidy data and pipelines.

Bioconductor is a separate package repository from CRAN (the usual package repository).

Bioconductor packages are for dealing with biological data efficiently. Bioconductor is not tidy. Expect to have to work a little harder to make use of these.

---

Too many uses to count, ask a different person and get a different list.

50% of bioinformatics is read this file format, wrangle, write other file format.

Often used in combination with command-line software (eg read aligner).

---

matrix is another tabular data type from base R. Conceptually, each cell is an observation, rather than each row as in a tidy data frame.

The rest are Bioconductor types. Note the use of CamelCase, this is typical in Bioconductor. Tidyverse separates words with underscores, and base R uses dots!

Bioconductor has evolved over time to cope with more complex data.

---

Aim for this session is to cover fundamentals of Bioconductor, so you can look up the package you need for your particular task and understand how to use it.
